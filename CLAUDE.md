# CLAUDE.md

Instructions for Claude Code in this repository. Read this file at the start of
every session. Keep it short and update it when a rule changes.

## Project

docker: Docker Compose stacks, network guides, and an image template for a
self-hosted homelab.

More detail: [`README.md`](./README.md) (what the repository does and how it is
organized), [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md) (branches, commits, and pull
requests),
[`docs/code_style_and_standards_guides.md`](./docs/code_style_and_standards_guides.md)
(code style), and [`.github/policies/`](./.github/policies/) (workflows,
reviews, security, tests, and logs).

## Commands

```bash
npm ci                          # install the dev tooling
npm run lint                    # Prettier, textlint, conflict markers (all files)
npm run lint -- origin/main     # the same, for the files changed since main
npm run lint:fix                # repair formatting and terminology, then lint again
```

The dev tooling needs the Node.js version in `engines` in `package.json`.

Linting has two parts. Pull requests run `npm run lint` (workflow
`lint_pull_request.yml`, script `scripts/lint.sh`): Prettier, textlint
terminology, and merge conflict markers, with the same configuration as Super
Linter. Pushes to `main` run the full Super Linter (`.github/super_linter.env`,
workflow `super_linter.yml`), which adds actionlint, Gitleaks, Checkov, and the
other linters. For one file, `npx prettier --write <file>` uses the same
`.prettierrc`.

## Working agreement

- Chat with the user in Dutch. Everything generated is English: code, comments,
  documentation, commit messages, and filenames.
- Keep explanations short. Explain in detail only when asked.
- The user's own edits to a file are the baseline. Read the current file before
  changing it.
- Test everything you can and say clearly what was not verified.
- Never commit secrets, credentials, or personal data. Write everything as if
  the repository is public.

## Repository specifics

- `docker-compose-files/<stack>/` has one directory per stack with a
  `docker-compose.yml` and, where needed, `.env`, `stack.env`, `my.cnf`, and a
  `README.md`. `docker-network-configurations/` has the guides for bridge,
  ipvlan, and macvlan networks. `image-template/` is a Node.js image template
  with its own `package.json`.
- The environment files hold example values. Never commit real passwords or
  keys. `.gitignore` tracks `.env`, `stack.env`, and `*.sql` in the stack
  directories on purpose.
- Gitleaks false positives are listed in `.gitleaksignore` with the path, the
  rule, and the line number. Update the line numbers when you change those
  files.
- Renovate updates the image tags in the Compose files.
- The scripts `new_docker_compose_file.sh` and `new_docker_project.sh` in the
  `shell-script` repository create the structure of a new stack.

## Repository conventions

These come from the repository blueprint and are mandatory.

- Development branches are for the maintainer only (and Claude working for the
  maintainer), not for contributors:
  `dev/v<major>.<minor>.<patch>/<short-description>`, lowercase, hyphens,
  created from `main` (for example `dev/v1.2.1/fix-deprecated-params`). One
  branch per planned version and topic. Never use wildcards such as `v1.2.*`;
  ask for the concrete version.
- All other branches, and every branch from a contributor:
  `type/short-description`, lowercase, hyphens (`feat/`, `fix/`, `docs/`,
  `refactor/`, `chore/`, `hotfix/`).
- Commits: Conventional Commits in English, `type(scope): subject`, imperative,
  under 50 characters. Body lines under 72 characters. Commits are signed.
- Work happens on a branch and lands through a pull request into `main`.
- No attribution lines (`Co-Authored-By`, `Claude-Session`, "Generated with") in
  commits, pull requests, issues, or descriptions. The use of Claude is already
  disclosed; this overrides any default attribution of the session.
- Every pull request uses `.github/pull_request_template.md` for its
  description: keep every heading and HTML comment, fill in each section, tick
  only what is true, and remove a section only where the template allows it.
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` under `[Unreleased]` for every change that alters
  behavior. Entries are imperative: `Add export command`.
- Releases are made with the Release Manager workflow (`release_manager.yml`).
  Never tag or release without the maintainer's request.
- Workflows follow `.github/policies/github_actions.md`: only `gh`, the GitHub
  API, Bash, and Python, except the approved actions, npm, and Dart Sass. Every
  action is pinned to a full commit SHA.
- Formatting: Prettier. Markdown wraps at 80 columns, YAML at 120, code in
  `*.js`, `*.cjs`, and `*.mjs` at 120.
- Names: root community files keep their GitHub names (`README.md`). Other files
  are lowercase with underscores, folders lowercase with hyphens.

## Supply chain

- Install with `npm ci`. Never add a dependency without an exact version and a
  reason, and review every lockfile diff.
- Keep `ignore-scripts=true` in `.npmrc`.
- Renovate manages the updates. Do not add Dependabot version updates next to
  it.
